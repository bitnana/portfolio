# Nana's Portfolio
This is Nana's portfolio.
Hello guys. Welcome to Nana's  Portfolio.

I was born in March.  March is Spring in Korea. That's why 'spring' is  the concept of my portfolio.
I  think Spring and I have in common.
Normally, people know that spring is the start of 4 seasons. And I start as Front-end developer.

I hope you have fun and feel my personality(brignt, joyful) when you come to my portfolio.
Thank you!
